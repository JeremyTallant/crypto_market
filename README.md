# Exploring the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Market
## Description
To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) we will, in this project, explore the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies.

**Warning: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile, and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Never invest money you can't afford to lose.**
## Usage
Clone this repository and open the Jupyter notebook file (`*.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment with Python kernel support. Make sure to install the required packages such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`. You can do this by running the following commands in a code cell within the notebook:
```python
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```
Once the packages are installed, run the code cells in the notebook to generate the plots and analyses.

If you don't have a Jupyter environment set up, you can install Jupyter Notebook and the Python kernel using the following steps:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions on the [official Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

2. Ensure you have Python installed. If not, you can download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
